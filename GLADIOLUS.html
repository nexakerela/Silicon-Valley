            Gladiolus is grown for its attractive
flower spike having florets of huge form,
dazzling colour and varying sizes, with long
vase life.
        </p>

<h2>Varieties</h2>
<p>
  Friendship, Spic and Span, Mansoer Red,
Dr. Fleming, Peter Pears and White Friendship are some of the common
varieties. Varieties evolved in India are Sapna,
Poonam, Nazrana, Apsara, Agnirekha, Mayur,
Suchithra, Manmohan, Manohar, Muktha,
Archana, Arun and Shobha.
</p>

<h2>Soil</h2>
<p>
  It can be grown in a wide range of soils,light sandy to clay loam. Deep well-drained
  acidic soils with a pH of 5.5-6.5 are the best
  for cultivation.
</p>

<h2>Propagation</h2>
<p>
  Gladiolus is propagated by corms and
cormels. Size of the corm markedly influences
the growth and flowering of gladiolus. Medium
and large sized corms are preferred for planting,
as small corms produce only small flower
spikes.
</p>

<h2>Planting</h2>
<p>
  The land is ploughed two or three
times and FYM @ 25 t ha-1 is applied and
mixed well with the soil. Ridges are made
20 cm apart. Fertilizer application is made
@ 50:60:60 kg N:P2O5
:K2
O per ha. The corms
are planted at a distance of 30 cm and at 5 cm
depth. About one lakh plants can be
accomodated in a hectare. Top dress the crop
with 50 kg N, 45 days after planting and earth
up. Best season for planting is SeptemberNovember.
</p>

<h2>Irrigation</h2>
<p>
  The crop has to be irrigated once in two or
three days depending upon soil and weather
conditions.
</p>

<h2>Plant protection</h2>
<p>
  Several species of aphids like green peach
aphid, potato aphid and melon aphid damage
developing foliage and flowers. They can be
controlled by using dimethoate. Thrips and
caterpillars can be controlled with dimethoate.
</p><p>
  Brown and Fusarium wilts are the
major diseases. Spraying the crop with
0.3 per cent copper oxychloride or drenching
carbendazim 0.05 per cent is recommended
when diseases are noticed.
</p>

<h2>Harvesting and yield</h2>
<p>
  The plant starts flowering in 2-3 months
after planting based on the variety. The
entire spike along with two leaves is cut, when
the basal flower bud starts opening. Nearly
2 lakh flower spikes can be obtained from one
hectare
</p>
<p>
  After harvest of flowers, the plants are left
undisturbed in the field. When they start
yellowing, the plants are uprooted for
harvest of corms and cormels.
