            Beet root can be grown in high ranges from
August to January. Well-drained sandy loam
soils are best suited for the crop.

<h2>Planting requirements</h2>
<p>
    Seed rate is 7 to 8 kg ha-1. It is usually grown
on ridges to facilitate good root
production. Ridges of about 20 cm height are
formed 45 cm apart and seeds sown 15-20 cm
apart on the rows. The seeds are mixed with
fine sand and placed in rows by hand and
covered with soil to make it firm
around it.
</p>

<h2>Manures and fertilizers</h2>
<p>
    Apply FYM 20 t ha-1 as basal. N:P2O5
: K2O
75:37.5:37.5 kg ha-1 is recommended. Full dose
of P2O5
and K2
O and half dose of N are
applied as basal. Remaining half dose of
nitrogen is applied as topdressing when the plant
starts growing vigorously
</p>

<h2>After cultivation</h2>
<p>
    It is necessary that enough soil moisture is
available to help uniform seed germination and
growth of plant. Thinning the population may
be done as in carrot. Weeding should be done
at regular intervals to keep down the weeds.
Shallow hoeing is necessary to facilitate root
growth. When the root starts growing, earthing
up should be done.
