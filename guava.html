            Guava thrives well in places receiving
medium rainfall not exceeding 100 cm. In
heavy rainfall areas, plants grow luxuriantly,
but produce insipid and low quality friuts.
It grows well on any type of soil. Red sandy
loam soil with good drainage is the most ideal
for commercial cultivation of guava.

<h2>Varieties</h2>
<p>
    Allahabad Safeda, Sardar (Lucknow-49),
    Red Fleshed, Apple Coloured and Pear Shaped. 
</p>

<h2>Planting material</h2>
<p>
    Air layering is widely adopted for
propagation of selected varieties. Layers strike
roots within 3-5 weeks. When the roots grow
through the ball of moss, the stem may be
severed below the girdled area in stages. The
polythene film is removed from the
finally severed rooted stem, which is then
potted and kept in the shade until new leaves
appear. When the new flushes are produced,
the plant can be hardened in full sunlight
preparatory to transplanting in the field
</p>

<h2>Planting</h2>
<p>
    Pits of one metre cube are made 6 m apart.
    Fill the pits with topsoil, sand and cowdung.
    Layers are planted in the centre of the pit.
    Staking of plants is also done, if necessary.
    After planting, mulching with dry leaves should
    be done to conserve moisture. June-July is the
    ideal time for planting. Plants should be irrigated
    in summer. Square system of planting
    facilitates easy orchard operations. Guava can
    be grown as an intercrop in coconut gardens.  
</p>


<h2> Manuring</h2>
<p>
    A fully grown-up bearing plant should be
    manured with about 80 kg of FYM, 200 g N,
    80 g P2O5
     and 260 g K2
    O. These may be
    applied in two or three split doses when there
    is sufficient moisture in the soil.    
</p>

<h2> Yield</h2>
<p>
    Guava layers start bearing from 3-4 years
after planting. About 500-800 fruits per year
can be obtained from a 10 year old tree.
</p>

<h2>Fruit rot disease</h2>
<p>
    This is a serious disease of guava especially
during rainy season. The symptoms are
manifested as development of dark brown
circular spots at the blossom end of the
immature green fruits.
</p>

<h2> Guava wilt</h2>
<p>
    In affected trees, the branches wither and
die one after another and in a few weeks or
months the tree, which seemed entirely healthy
will be dead. Remove such trees as soon as
the symptoms are identified to prevent the
spread of the disease.
</p>


<h2> Fruit fly</h2>
<p>
    This is a serious pest of guava. The insect
affects the fruit when it matures. The infested
fruits show depression with dark green
punctures. As a precautionary measure, the
crop should be sprayed just before fruit
maturity with dimethoate (0.05 per cent).
