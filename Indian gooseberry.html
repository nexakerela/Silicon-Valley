            Indian Gooseberry/Emblica/Nelli is quite
            hardy and can be grown with little care in all
            types of soil except very sandy type. It
            prefers a warm dry climate and is found in the
            dry deciduous forests of Kerala
        </p>
       
        <h2>Varieties</h2>
        <p>
            Much genetic variability exists in this
species. However, a high yielding larger fruited
variety was located from the rain shadow
region of the Western Ghats and popularized
as “Chambakad Large”. Other varieties are
Banarasi, Krishna and Kanchan.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Cultivation</h2>
        <p>
            Emblica is usually propagated by seeds and
vegetatively by wedge grafting. The seeds are
enclosed in a hard seed coat, which renders
the germination difficult. The seeds can be
extracted by sun drying ripe fruits for about
2-3 days till they split open releasing the seeds.
The seeds can be directly sown. Gooseberry
can be vegetatively propagated through root
suckers also.
        </p>
        <p>
            One year old seedlings can be planted in
the field during rainy season at a spacing of 8
m x 8 m. It can be planted as windbreak around
the orchard.
        </p>
        <p>
            No serious pests or diseases are
generally found in this crop.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Harvesting</h2>
        <p>
            Seedlings will commence bearing from the
10th year and the grafts in 3-4 years. The
vegetative growth of the tree continues from
April to July. Along with the new growth in the
spring, flowering commences. Fruits will
mature by January-February. Yield ranges
between 30-50 kg per tree per year when full
grown.
