            Cauliflower can be grown successfully in
            the plains as well as high ranges of Kerala.
            Well drained soil with open sunlight is ideal for
            growth of the crop.

        <h2>Planting requirements</h2>
        <p>
            Since it is a cool season crop sowing is to
            be done during October – November. Seed
            rate is 600 – 750 g/ha. Seeds are to be sown
            in nursery beds or in protrays. The trays should
            be filled with a mixture of well decomposed
            196 CABBAGE AND CAULIFLOWER
            CARROT (Daucus carota)
            Carrot can be grown in high ranges from
            August to January. Well-drained sandy loam
            soil is best suited for the crop.
            Varieties
            Pusa Kesar, Nantes, Pusa Meghali, Pusa
            Nayanjyothi F1
             (suited for commercial
            cultivation in the tropical plains of Kerala).
            Planting requirements
            Seed rate is 5-6 kg ha-1. It is usually sown
            on ridges to facilitate good root production
            Ridges of about 20 cm height are made
            45 cm apart and seeds sown 10 cm apart on
            the rows. The seed is mixed with fine sand
            and sown in rows by hand and covered with
            soil to make it firm around it.
            Manures and fertilizers
            Apply 25 t ha-1 FYM before sowing.
            cocopeat, perlite and vermiculite (3:1:1 by
            volume). Germinated seedlings should be
            fertigated with 19:19:19/20:20:20/30:10:10
            water soluble fertiliser @ 0.05 – 0.2%
            depending on the stage of growth of seedlings.
            The seedlings will be ready for transplanting
            within 3-4 weeks.
        </p>
<p>
    The main field is prepared by ploughing the
soil well. Trenches of 20cm depth should be
taken at a spacing of 60 cm. Apply the basal
dose of organic manures and fill the trenches
up to 10 cm using top soil. Plant the seedlings
in trenches at a spacing of 60 cm.
</p>

<h2>Manures and Fertilisers</h2>
<p>
    Apply 25t ha-1 FYM or compost. Fertiliser
    dose is N:P2O5
    :K2
    O 150:100:125 kg ha-1. Apply
    half the dose of N, K and full dose of P2O5
     5-
    7 days after transplanting. Apply the remaining
    N & K after one month of planting
</p>

<h2>After cultivation</h2>
<p>
    A continuous supply of moisture is
    necessary for proper development of curds.
    Very shallow hoeing should be done at weekly
    intervals to remove weeds and better aeration
    of soil. Earth up the plant one month after
    transplanting.
</p>

<h2>Plant protection</h2>
<p>
    Damping off disease in nursery beds can
    be controlled by applying copper oxy chloride
    (2 g l -1).
