            Carrot can be grown in high ranges from
            August to January. Well-drained sandy loam

        </p>
<h2>Varieties</h2>
<p>
    Pusa Kesar, Nantes, Pusa Meghali, Pusa
    Nayanjyothi F1
     (suited for commercial
    cultivation in the tropical plains of Kerala).
</p>

<h2>Planting requirements</h2>
<p>
    Seed rate is 5-6 kg ha-1. It is usually sown
    on ridges to facilitate good root production
    Ridges of about 20 cm height are made
    45 cm apart and seeds sown 10 cm apart on
    the rows. The seed is mixed with fine sand
    and sown in rows by hand and covered with
    soil to make it firm around it.
</p>

<h2>Manures and fertilizers</h2>
<p>
    Apply 25 t ha-1 FYM before sowing.Fertilizer recommendation is 75:62.5:50 NPK
    kg ha-1. A fertilizer dose of 37.5 kg N, 62.5 kg
    P2O5
     and 50 kg K2
    O per ha as basal.
    Topdressing with 37.5 kg N per ha may be
    done one month after sowing
</p>

<h2>After cultivation</h2>
<p>
    It is necessary that enough soil moisture is
    available to help uniform seed germination
    and growth of plant. Uproot excess
    seedlings (thinning) three weeks after
    sowing leaving a plant to plant spacing of
    10 cm to facilitate better tuber growth.
    Weeding should be done at regular intervals to
    keep down the weeds. Shallow hoeing is
    necessary to facilitate root growth. When the
    root starts growing, earthing up should
    be done.
