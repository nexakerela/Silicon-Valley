        Cabbage can be grown successfully in the
        plains as well as high ranges of Kerala. Well
        drained soil with open sunlight is ideal for
        growth of the crop.
       </p>

       <h2>Varieties</h2>
        <p>
            NS 43, NS 160, NS 183.
        </p>

        <h2>Planting requirements</h2>
        <p>
            Since it is a cool season crop sowing is to
be done during October – November. Seed
rate is 600 – 750 g/ha-1. Seeds are to be sown
in nursery beds or in protrays. The trays should
be filled with a mixture of well decomposed
cocopeat, perlite and vermiculite (3:1:1 by
volume). Germinated seedlings should be
fertigated with 19:19:19/20:20:20/30:10:10
water soluble fertilizer @ 0.05 – 0.2%
depending on the stage of growth of seedlings.
The seedlings will be ready for transplanting
within 3-4 weeks. Damping off disease in
nursery beds can be controlled by applying
copper oxy chloride (0.3%).
        </p>
        <p>
            The main field is prepared by ploughing the
soil well. Trenches of 20 cm depth should be
taken at a spacing of 60 cm. Apply the basal
dose of organic manures and fill the trenches
up to 10 cm using top soil. Plant the seedlings
in trenches at a spacing of 60 cm.
        </p>

<h2>Manures and Fertilisers</h2>
<p>
    Apply 25t/ha FYM or compost. Fertiliser
dose is N:P2O5
:K2
O 150:100:125 kg/ha. Apply
half the dose of N, K and full dose of P2O5
5-
7 days after transplanting. Apply the remaining
N & K after one month of planting.
</p>

<h2>After cultivation</h2>
<p>
    A continuous supply of moisture is
necessary for proper development of curds.
Very shallow hoeing should be done at weekly
intervals to remove weeds and better aeration
of soil. Earth up the plant one month after
transplanting.
</p>

<h2>Plant protection</h2>
<p>
    Army worms and semi loopers are the
major pests. Spraying quinalphos 0.25%
controls the pests. Black rot is a serious
problem which can be controlled by spraying
streptocyclin 300 ppm. Weekly application of
Pseudomonas fluorescens 2% solution after
the head initiation also controls the disease.
Collar rot is observed in soils with poor
drainage and aeration. Incidence of collar rot
can be managed by weekly hoeing. Drenching
Pseudomonas fluorescens 2% controls the
disease.
