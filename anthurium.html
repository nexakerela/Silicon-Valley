<p>
Anthurium is one of the importanteconomic flowers of export potential. There
are more than 500 species and several varieties.
Few of them are commercially important.

</p>

Anthurium andreanum, is economically
cultivated for cut flowers. They are partially
epiphytic in growth habit. Plants prefer to grow
under shade. The tolerable level of light in the
tropical region during summer is 20-30 per cent.
Excess light causes yellowing and scorching
of leaves. Very low light intensity causes
excessive vegetative growth and low
flowering. It is preferable to grow anthurium
in the open, under artificial shade structures
for better growth and yield. Plant prefers to
grow under a relative humidity of not less than
60 per cent and a temperature of not more
than 18-28o

<h2>Propagation</h2>
<p>
  Anthurium is multiplied by seed and
  vegetatively by stem cuttings or by separation of
  basal sprouts. Propagation by seed is not
  recommended as a commercial propagation
  method as it results in high variability. Plants
  can be multiplied in large number by
  micro-propagation techniques from the
  tender leaf bits.
</p>

<h2>Varities</h2>
<p>
  The economic varieties suitable for Kerala
  condition are Lima White, Cuba, Agnihotri,
  Liver Red, Can Can, Tropical, Nitta, Sunburst,
  Linda-de-Mol, Tinora, Acropolis, Gino Orange
  and Midori.
</p>

<h2>Planting and after care</h2>
<p> 
  Plants are propagated vegetatively by
separating suckers from flowering plants as
and when available and planted in the
medium. Cutting the thick main stem into
3-4 cm long discs and then into vertical bits
can also be done. Each bit should have
minimum two lateral buds. Cut-pieces are
treated with a fungicide solution and planted
on a medium of clean river sand. Cuttings will
take 1-2 months for sprouting.
</p>
<p>
Seedlings and sprouted cuttings of
5-10 cm height are transferred to the main field
or pots. Planting in pots is preferred in the plains.
Cultivation in beds is good at higher altitudes
(about 1000 m above MSL). A loose medium
above the ground is suitable for
anthurium. Old and chopped coconut husk (3
cm size) mixed with brick pieces and
charcoal are filled in narrow trenches 10 cm
below and above ground level.
</p>
<p>
Pots can also be filled with the same
mixture. An ideal pot should be 30 cm
diameter at top with 3 large holes at the bottom
on sides. One plant can be planted in a pot. On
ground, the spacing is 45 to 60 cm depending
upon the variety. Fresh cowdung or neem cake
mixed with 10-15 times of water, kept for 4-5
days, can be sprayed on the plants after
filtering. Cowâ€™s urine can be sprayed or
drenched after mixing with 25 times of water.
Water soluble fertilizer (19:19:19) 2 g / l is
applied in the medium once a week. Slow
release fertilizers, if used, need be given only
once in 2-3 months. Pruning of older leaves,
removal of suckers at young stage, cleaning of
crown before rains etc. are other operations to
be carried out in order to have a better growth
and flowering

<h2>Diseases</h2>
<p>
  The two major diseases are bacterial blight
  and anthracnose. Blackening of the stem and
  decay of leaf axils are the symptoms of
  bacterial blight. Spraying a mixture of
  turmeric powder and sodium bi carbonate in
  the proportion 10:1@ 0.15 per cent at weekly
  interval from the initiation of the disease is
  effective for the management of bacterial blight
  of anthurium.
</p>
<p>
  Tiny circular black spots appear on leaf and
  spadix in case of anthracnose. Spraying
  mancozeb 0.3 per cent or carbendazim 0.05
  per cent can control the disease.
</p>
<p>
  Root rot caused by Pythium and
  Phytophthora can be controlled by the
  application of potassium phosphonate 0.3 per
  cent  
</p>

<h2>Pests</h2>
<p>
  The major pests are scales and bugs, which
  are controlled by spraying malathion @ 2 ml
  per litre of water. Snails also cause damage to
  young roots. Use of metaldehyde can prevent
  the attack of snails.
</p>

<h2>Harvesting</h2>
<p>
  The flowers are harvested with its long stem
  when 1/4thto 3/4th flowers on the spadix are open,
  indicated by the change of colour. Colour
  change varies with the varieties.
