        <p>
            Tuberose occupies a very special position
among the ornamental bulbous plants because
of its prettiness, elegance and fragrance. It has
good economic potential for loose/cut flower
trade and essential oil industry
        </p>

        <h2>Cultivars</h2>
        <p>
            There are three groups of cultivars as given
below:
        </p>
        <p>
            1. Single: Flower is pure white and has only
a single row of corolla segments.
Cultivars are Sringar, Culcutta Single,
Mexican Single and Suvarna Rekha.
        </p>
        <p>
            2. Double: Flowers are white, tinged with
pinkish red. Petals are in several whorls.
Cultivars are Suvasini, Culcutta Double
and Pearl.
        </p>
        <p>
            3. Semi-double: Similar to double but with
only 2 to 3 rows of corolla segments.
This classification is based on floral
characters.
        </p>

        <h2>  Soil</h2>
        <p>
            Porous, well-drained sandy loam soils are
best suited for tuberose cultivation.
        </p>

        <h2>Propagation</h2>
        <p>
            Propagation is by bulbs. Boat shaped bulbs
of size 2 to 3 cm are preferred for
planting. About 1.25 to 1.50 lakh bulbs
(800 to 900 kg) are required for planting one
hectare
        </p>

        <h2>Cultural practices</h2>
        <p>
            Land is prepared well by ploughing two or
three times. FYM @ 30 t ha-1 is mixed well
with soil. Best time for planting is May-July. The
bulbs preferably those of size 2-5 cm or above
are to be planted at a depth of 7-10 cm, with a
spacing of 20 cm x 25 cm. A fertilizer dosage
of 100:50:50 kg ha-1 N:P2O5
:K2
O is recommended. Of these, half N, full P2O5
 and K2O
are applied at the time of planting.
Remaining N is applied when the flower spikes
start to appear. A heavy irrigation once in 5-10
days is necessary depending upon the weather
conditions. The peak flowering is between June
and October.
        </p>

        <h2>Ratoon crop</h2>
        <p>
            After the harvest of the main crop, the
flower stalks are headed back and the plot is
manured and irrigated. Three or four ratoon
crops can be taken from single planting
        </p>

        <h2>Plant protection</h2>
        <p>
            Slugs and grass hoppers, which feed on the
    leaves and thrips which damage and cause distortion of the spikes are the major pests.
    Malathion is effective against these pests. No
    major disease is noticed.
        </p>

        <h2> Harvest and yield</h2>
        <p>
            Tuberose is harvested by cutting the spikes
    from the base for table decoration or the
    individual flower is picked from the spike for
    making garlands and other floral ornaments:
        </p>
        <p>
            The average yield of flower is as follows:
    Plant crop: 5-10 t ha-1
    First ratoon: 9-12 t ha-1
    Second ratoon: 4-6 t ha-1
        </p>
