            Clove requires a warm humid tropical
            climate with an annual rainfall from
            150-250 cm. It grows well from mean sea level
            up to an altitude of 800-900 m. Deep loam soils
            with high humus content and black loams of
            semi-forest regions with good drainage are suited for the cultivation of the crop.
</p>
           
<h2>Selection of site</h2>
<p>
    Select partially shaded sites having
adequate protection from high winds. Avoid
exposed and shady locations.
</p>

<h2>Seeds and sowing</h2>
<p>
    Clove is propagated through seeds
obtained from fully developed fruits known as
mother of clove. Collect fully developed fruits
from high yielding mother trees. Dehusk the
fruits immediately after collection by soaking
in water and peeling. Prepare raised nursery
beds with fertile soil rich in humus under the
shade of trees. Sow the seeds flat at a depth
2-5 cm and a spacing of 12-15 cm. Water the
beds regularly. Seedlings can either be retained
in the nursery till they attain a height of 25-30 cm
when they are ready for transplanting or
potted when they are six months old and
transplanted after another 12-18 months.
</p>

<h2>Planting</h2>
<p>
    Select 18 months old seedlings for
planting. Prepare pits of size 60 cm x 60 cm x
60 cm at a spacing of 6 m x 6 m about a month
in advance of planting. Allow to weather. Fill
up the pits with mixture of burnt earth, compost
and topsoil. Plant the seedlings during the rainy
season, May-June or August-September.
Provide shade and irrigation during breaks in
the monsoon and summer. Banana or glyricidia
may be planted to provide shade.
</p>
<p>
    Clove is generally grown as a mixed crop
with coffee, coconut, arecanut etc.
</p>

<h2>Manuring</h2>
<p>
    Apply cattle manure or compost at the rate
of 15 kg per tree per annum during
May-June. The recommended fertilizer dose
is N:P2O5: K2
O @ 20:18:50 g per plant
during the first year and @ 40:36:100 g per
plant during the second year. Increase gradually
the dose to 300:250:750 g per plant per year
for a well grown tree of 15 years or more.
Apply organic manures in May-June with the
commencement of southwest monsoon. Apply
fertilizers in two equal split doses in May-June
along with the organic manures and in
September-October in shallow trenches dug
around the plant about 1 to 1.25 m away from
the base.
</p>

<h2>After cultivation</h2>
<p>
    Conduct weeding and intercultivation
whenever necessary. Cut and remove dead and
diseased branches of fully grown trees to
prevent over crowding. Spray one per cent
Bordeaux mixture to control dieback.
</p>

<h2>Harvesting and curing</h2>
<p>
    The trees begin to yield from 7-8 years after
planting. The stage of harvest of flower buds
determine the quality of the final dried product.
Buds are harvested when the base of calyx
has turned from green to pink in colour. If
allowed to develop beyond this stage, the buds
open, petals drop and an inferior quality spice
is obtained on drying.
</p>
<p>
    Prior to drying, buds are removed from the
stem by holding the cluster in one hand and
pressing it against the palm of the other with a
slight twisting movement. The clove buds and
stems are piled separately or drying. Buds may
be sorted to remove over ripe cloves and fallen
flowers. Drying should be done immediately
after the buds are separated from the clusters.
If left too long in heaps, they ferment and the
dried spice has a whitish shriveled appearance
(khoker clove).
</p>
<p>
    The traditional method of drying is by
exposing them to sun in mats. The green buds
are spread out in a thin layer on the drying
floor and are raked from time to time to
ensure the development of a uniform colour
and to prevent mould formation. In sunny
weather, drying is completed in 4-5 days
giving a bright coloured dried spice of
attractive appearance. During drying, clove
loses about two-third of its original fresh green
weight. When properly dried, it will turn bright
brown and does not bend when pressed. The dried cloves are sorted to remove mother of
cloves and khoker cloves, bagged and stored
in a dry place. The stem after separation of
buds is dried in a similar manner as the spice,
without allowing mould formation and
fermentation.
</p>

<h2>Pests</h2>
<p>
    Infestation of shoot borer Sinoxylon sp. can
be controlled by pruning off the laterals of old
trees showing dieback symptoms. Do not allow
dried glyricidia and other twigs to
remain in the plantation, to ensure that the
beetles will not multiply on these materials and
subsequently initiate infestation in cloves.
</p>

<h2>Diseases</h2>
<p>
    Leaf spot, twig blight and flower bud
shedding (Colletotrichum gloeosporioides)
</p>
<p>
    Three types of symptoms are seen viz., leaf
spot, twig blight and flower bud shedding. On
the leaves, necrotic spots of variable sizes and
shapes are noticed. Severely affected leaves
wither, drop and dry up. In the nursery
seedlings, dieback symptoms are seen.
Extension of the symptoms from the leaves
through petioles results in the infection of twigs.
The affected branches stand without leaves
or only with young leaves at the tips. The
flower buds are attacked by spread of infection
from the twigs. Shedding of flower buds occur
during periods of heavy and continuous
rainfall.
</p>
<p>
    Management
</p>
<p>
    Spraying 1 per cent Bordeaux mixture at
1-1.5 month intervals reduces disease intensity,
defoliation and flower bud shedding. The
spraying has to be commenced just prior to
flower bud formation and continued till the
harvest of flower buds for effective control.
Destruction of the weed Clerodendron from
the clove garden is recommended to reduce
the disease since the pathogen survives on this
weed during adverse conditions.
</p>
<p>
    The other diseases of clove are:
Grey blight of clove (Pestalotia palmarum),
Leaf spot of clove (Cylindrocladium
quinqueseptatum), Leaf spot of clove
(Alternaria citri), Sooty mould of clove
(Phragmocapnius sp.), Algal leaf spot of
clove (Cephaleuros sp.).
