        <p>
            Mandarin orange is a subtropical fruit
growing in the high ranges of Kerala. It
requires deep soil rich in humus. The crop
cannot withstand waterlogging. It is grown in
regions having good drainage.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Preparation of land</h2>
        <p>
            Dig pits of size 70 cm x 60 cm x 70 cm at a
spacing of 7-8 m at least one month in
advance of planting.
        </p>

        <h2>Planting material</h2>
        <p>
            Use budded plants for planting. For
raising seedlings, extract seeds from selected
fruits by squeezing. Wash the seeds free of
pulp and dry them. Make seedbeds 1.5 m long,
1 m wide and 15 cm height. Sow the seeds
giving a spacing of 13 cm in a row and 3 cm
between the rows. Thin the seedlings if
necessary or plant selected seedlings in
secondary nursery. For budding, use rough
lemon (jambhiri) seedlings as rootstock. Raise
the rootstock seedlings in a nursery and when
they are 18-24 months old, budding may be
done by the inverted “T” method. The best
time for budding is from July to September. A
month after insertion, lop off the vegetative
growth of the seedling above the bud joint
completely. The budded plants are ready for
planting in 6-12 months.
        </p>

        <h2>Time and method for planting</h2>
        <p>
            Planting is done during July-August. Lift the
plants carefully with a ball of earth around the
roots and plant them carefully without
disturbing the roots. While planting, remove the
bandage around the bud joint and keep the bud
joint at least 10-15 cm above soil surface.
Remove the vegetative growth arising below
the bud union periodically
        </p>

        <h2>Manuring</h2>
        <p>
            The manuring schedule recommended is
given below.
        </p>

        <img src="Mandarin Orangepictable.png">
        <p>
            Apply organic manure in May and
fertilizers in two equal split doses during JuneJuly and in September-October. In addition to
the above manures and fertilizers, spray
micronutrients such as zinc sulphate 500 g,
copper sulphate 500 g, manganese sulphate
300 g and lime 500 g in 100 litres of water per
ha twice in a year during March and OctoberNovember.
        </p>

        <h2>After cultivation</h2>
        <p>
            Give a light digging or ploughing when the
rains start.
        </p>

        <h2>Pruning</h2>
        <p>
            In the early stages, give some formative
pruning to establish a strong framework.
Remove all shoots arising from rootstock
below the bud union. Remove dead branches
and smear the cut ends with Bordeaux paste.
Do not prune the roots.
        </p>
  
        <h2>Intercropping</h2>
        <p>
            Crops like coffee, cardamom, banana and
pineapple can be planted as intercrops
depending on soil fertility status.
        </p>
       
        <h2>Plant protection</h2>
        <p>
            For controlling citrus butterfly, hand
picking of caterpillars and spraying with a
contact insecticide are to be done.
        </p>
        <p>
            To control stem borer incidence, chip off
the affected new shoots inject 1 per cent
dichlorvos into the tunnels. To control aphids
apply dimethoate 0.05 per cent.
        </p>
        <p>
            Stem borers (Chelidonium sp.,
Chloridolum sp. and Nupserha sp.) cause
withering of branches. Gum exudes from holes
on stems and branches. Accumulation of wood
dust on ground around the base is another
symptom of borer damage.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cutting and burning of the affected
branches and injecting petrol during May is
recommended against the borers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Among diseases, dieback, root and
collar rot are important. Periodical removal of
dried twigs and application of Bordeaux paste
on cut ends and application of Bordeaux
mixture 1 per cent can control dieback disease.
        </p>
<p>
    Against root and collar rot, removal of soil
from the base of the trunk, scraping of the dead
bark and application of lime sulphur
are to be done. As an alternative, smear
Bordeaux paste over the treated roots and
stem. Exposing the main roots to a depth of
about 30 cm is also advised.
