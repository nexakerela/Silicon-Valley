            Orchids are noted for their bewitchingly
            beautiful, long lasting flowers, widely
            differing in shape, size and colour. They
            belong to the family Orchidaceae, reported to
            comprise over 600 genera, 30000 species and
            about 1.5 lakhs man made hybrids. They have
            varying habitats but epiphytic orchids
            dominate the trade. They are also classed as
            monopodials (stems having a vertical growth,
            non branching, with aerial roots) and sympodials
            (stems having a horizontal growth, producing
            pseudobulbs in clusters, no aerial roots).
        </p>
<p>
    The ideal location for orchid growing is in
    the open conditions, under appropriate level of
    shade. In Kerala certain orchids are grown
    under the shade of old coconut trees.
</p>
<p>
    Most attractive orchids belong to the group
    of epiphytes, which require free
    moving air at all times. They produce aerial
    roots, which absorb water and nutrients from the atmosphere. Both terrestrial and epiphytes
    grow under varying levels of shade. Plants
    grown under deep shade will have good
    vegetative growth and poor flowering. Hence
    shade and light regulations are very important
    operations for better flowering. A humid and
    warm atmosphere is congenial for the growth
    of most of the tropical orchids. Better results
    are obtained when the atmospheric humidity
    is 50 to 80 per cent. Orchids require proper
    temperature for good growth and flowering.
    Accordingly there are tropical, subtropical and
    temperate orchids.
</p>

<h2>Genera/varieties</h2>
<p>
  The popular genera of orchids
  that are suitable for growing in Kerala are
  Arachnis, Aranthera, Vanda, Phalaenopsis
  (monopodials); Aranda, Mokara (intergeneric monopodials); Dendrobium,
  Cattleya, Oncidium (sympodials).
</p>
<p>
  Dendrobium is the most popular genus of
Kerala. Some of the important varieties
belonging to this genus are given below,
grouped according to colour.
</p>

  Purple and white : Sonia 17, Sonia 28, Sonia
Bom Jo and Earsakul
</p>
<p>
  Purple : Renappa, New Wanee, Sabine Red,
Jurie Red, Master Delight and Velvet Soft
</p>
<p>
  White : Emma White, Fairy White, Kasem
White and Snow White
</p>
<p>
  Pink : Sakura Pink, New Pink, Lemon Glow
and Pink Cascade
</p>
<p>
  Yellow : Sherifa Fatimah, Kasem Gold and
Tongchai Gold
</p>
<p>

<h2>Propagation</h2>
<p>
  The conventional method of propagation is
by vegetative means. Monopodial orchids are
propagated by stem cuttings. Terminal cuttings
with one or two healthy aerial roots are ideal
as planting material. Basal cuttings of 30 cm
length with a few roots and leaves are also
good. But they take longer time to sprout and
grow. Sympodial orchids are propagated by
separation of pseudobulbs. A plant with
minimum two or three pseudobulbs with the
basal root is ideal for planting. Some of the
sympodial varieties produce sprouts at the top
of pseudobulb called as keikis. Keikis when
fully grown can be separated and planted.
Besides, back-bulbs or spent canes (shoots that
have ceased to produce flowers) before they
get shrivelled can be severed from the mother
plant and placed horizontally over the medium
to stimulate sprouting of new shoots.
</p>
<p>
  Seed propagation is possible only under
aseptic conditions. Seedlings produced by
embryo culture will take 2-5 years for
flowering, depending on the genus.
</p>
<p>
  Meristem culture is very effective in
large scale propagation of orchids.
</p>

<h2>Planting</h2>
<p>
  Terminal cuttings of monopodial orchids are
planted loosely on old coconut husks at a
spacing of 30 cm between plants and
45 cm between rows in long beds. There can
be two or three rows in a bed. Basal cuttings
will sprout within a period of two months.
Partial shade up to 50 per cent is required for
sprouting. Basal cuttings are planted close to
each other in nursery beds for sprouting. After
sprouting they are planted at the
recommended spacing. Monopodial orchids
can be grown on ground above soil level. A
thick bed of 15-20 cm height is loosely
arranged. Well-dried coconut husks are
better than fresh husks. Sympodial orchids are
grown on benches above ground level or
suspended from above. Slotted wooden baskets
filled with small pieces of dried coconut husk
or partially burnt charcoal is good for plant
growth. Planting is done above the medium
with a support for proper anchorage.
</p>
<p>
  Planting can also be done in pots or other
containers. Mud pots of 10-20 cm diameter
with several large holes on the side and
bottom, filled with tile bits, chopped coconut
husk or charcoal are used for planting. A clear
solution of fresh cowdung can be used for
irrigation for a few days. Dipping in fresh
cowdung solution before planting also gives
good results.
</p>

<h2>Manuring</h2>
<p>
  Monopodial orchids grown on ground can
be given cowdung slurry once in a month. One
kg fresh cowdung mixed in 5 litres of water is
sufficient for one square metre. Two to three
applications can be given in a year. Sympodial
orchids are sprayed with the supernatant liquid
of cowdung slurry. Nutrition of plants from the natural sources is not sufficient to support the
plants for economic production. Hence
additional feeding is required. Foliar feeding is
very effective in orchids. Fertilizer mixture of
N:P2O5:K2
O 3:1:1 can be applied during
vegetative period and 1:2:2 can be applied
during flowering period. The usual dose of such
mixture is 2-3 g per litre of water,
applied twice a week.
</p>

<h2>Diseases</h2>  
<p>
  The important fungal diseases are leaf spot,
leaf blight, collar blotch, collar rot and orchid
wilt.
</p>
<p>
  These can be controlled by application of
mancozeb, carbendazim etc. at the
recommended dose. Spraying should be done
prior to the commencement of monsoon and
at fortnightly intervals during heavy
monsoon. Important virus diseases are
mosaic and ring spot. Destroying the affected
plants can control spread of these diseases.
</p>

<h2>Pests</h2>
<p>
  The common pests attacking orchids are
thrips, aphids, spider mite, soft scale, mealy
bugs, orchid weevil, ants etc. Other very
serious pests of orchids are snails and slugs.
They feed on the tender young shoots, roots
and buds. Hand-picking is effective, if the
number of plants is less. They move out
during late night and hide before early morning.
Damage is caused during this period. All the
pests can be controlled by application of contact
and systemic insecticides at appropriate
concentration.
</p>

<h2>Harvesting</h2>
<p>
  The spikes are harvested before the
opening of all the buds of the spike, depending
on the genus.
